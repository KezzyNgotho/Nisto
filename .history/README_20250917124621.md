## 🔐 MPC (Multi-Party Computation) Features

### What is MPC?
Multi-Party Computation (MPC) is a cryptographic technique that allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. In Nisto, MPC enables:

- **Distributed Key Management**: Private keys are split across multiple parties
- **Threshold Signatures**: Transactions require multiple approvals (e.g., 2 of 3 parties)
- **No Single Point of Failure**: Even if one party is compromised, funds remain secure
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Parties can approve transactions without seeing each other's data

### MPC Use Cases

#### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Wallets
- Parents + children approval for expenses
- Shared family savings with multi-party control
- Educational spending with guardian oversight

#### 🏢 Business Accounts
- Board member approval for large transactions
- Department spending with manager approval
- Vendor payments with multiple signatories

#### 🌍 Social Media Integration
- **Instagram**: Send money to content creators privately
- **WhatsApp**: Split bills with group approval
- **Twitter**: Tip creators with family oversight
- **Telegram**: Group payments with privacy controls

### MPC Security Benefits
- **Enhanced Security**: No single point of failure
- **Privacy**: Private transfers and encrypted communications
- **Compliance**: Audit trails and regulatory compliance
- **Scalability**: Supports unlimited parties and wallets
- **User Experience**: Seamless approval workflows
